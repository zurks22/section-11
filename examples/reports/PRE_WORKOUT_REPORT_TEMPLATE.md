[If rest day: "Rest day — no sessions scheduled."]

Recommendation: [readiness_decision.recommendation — Go / Modify / Skip]

Interpretation:
[2-4 sentences: readiness vs baselines, load context,
suitability (proceed/modify/skip with rationale), coach tip.
Use readiness_decision.signals for individual signal values.
If recommendation is Modify, reference readiness_decision.modification
for adjustment directions (intensity/volume/cap_zone).
AI may override the pre-computed recommendation with explicit rationale.]

## Conditional Fields

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Weather | Include if athlete location is available via profile or memory |
| Coach note (weather) | Include only if actionable (e.g., dress warm, indoor day) |
| Feel (last session) | Omit if unavailable. Source: most recent activity in `recent_activities` with feel populated. Labels: 1=Strong, 2=Good, 3=Normal, 4=Poor, 5=Weak. Not a readiness signal — context only |
| Monotony | Include **only** if > 2.3. Omit entirely when normal |
| Durability | Include if qualifying sessions exist. Omit if 0 qualifying sessions in 7d |
| EF | Include if qualifying sessions exist. Omit if 0 qualifying sessions in 7d |
| TID 28d + drift | Include as separate line **only** if drift is "shifting" or "acute_depolarization". Omit entire line when "consistent" |
| Load/Recovery context | Include tolerance note only when within 0.2 of threshold |
| Next session | Include only on rest days |
| Modify/Skip rationale | Required when recommendation is not "Go" |

## Readiness Decision Logic

The `readiness_decision` object in `latest.json` provides a pre-computed go/modify/skip recommendation with priority level and individual signal statuses. Use this as the baseline.

**Signal statuses** are in `readiness_decision.signals` (hrv, rhr, sleep, tsb, acwr, ri — each with green/amber/red/unavailable and raw values).

**Phase-adjusted thresholds** are in `readiness_decision.phase_context` (shows which phase modifier shifted the amber threshold).

**Modification guidance** is in `readiness_decision.modification` when recommendation is "modify" (trigger categories + adjustment directions: intensity/volume/cap_zone).

> The AI may override the pre-computed recommendation with explicit rationale in the Interpretation section. The `readiness_decision` is the deterministic baseline, not a constraint. If contextual factors (dossier notes, conversation history, athlete-reported info) suggest a different call, explain why.

For the full priority ladder (P0–P3) and signal classification thresholds, see **Readiness Decision** in the protocol.

## Brevity Rule

- **Normal metrics, Go recommendation:** Keep interpretation to 2-3 sentences
- **Threshold breach or Modify/Skip:** Expand with specific reasoning
- **Rest day:** Brief — confirm recovery status, preview next session

## Formatting Rule

- **Durations and sleep:** Always use `_formatted` fields from JSON (e.g., `sleep_formatted`, `duration_formatted`, `total_training_formatted`). Never convert decimal `_hours` fields to display format — the formatted values are pre-calculated from raw seconds and avoid rounding errors.
