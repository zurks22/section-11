Intervals.icu → GitHub/Local JSON Export
Exports training data for LLM access.
Supports both automated GitHub sync and manual local export.

Version 3.101 - has_dfa split + dfa_summary: new has_dfa boolean on recent_activities[] in
  latest.json, independent from has_intervals. has_intervals semantics narrowed to structured
  segments only — a steady Z2 ride with AlphaHRV now reports has_intervals: false, has_dfa: true
  (previously the latter overloaded the former). New compact dfa_summary block attached when
  has_dfa: true AND quality.sufficient: true — fields: avg, dominant_band (max-pct, alphabetical
  tiebreak), tiz_pct (4 bands), valid_pct, sufficient, plus optional drift_delta/drift_interpretable
  and lt1/lt2 watts/hr (omitted when underlying data absent — never null-filled). Lets the AI
  write post-workout DFA commentary from latest.json alone for the common case. quality.sufficient
  tightened: previously duration-only (>=20 min valid); now also requires valid_pct >= 70%. New
  constant DFA_SUFFICIENT_MIN_VALID_PCT = 70.0. Excludes noisy AlphaHRV sessions that previously
  passed the duration gate (pre-existing latent bug). New helper _build_dfa_summary() — pure
  extractor, no computation, single source of truth shared with capability summary.

Version 3.100 - DFA power calibration indoor/outdoor split: trailing_by_sport.cycling lt1/lt2
  estimates now split watts by environment (watts_outdoor, watts_indoor — always present, null
  when no qualifying sessions). HR stays pooled. Per-environment n_sessions for depth assessment.
  Shared _is_indoor_cycling() resolver (VirtualRide = indoor) replaces inline checks.
  Non-cycling sports unchanged. Activity name anonymization removed — names pass through as-is
  for coaching context (route identification, terrain association). athlete_id always redacted.
  
Version 3.99 - DFA a1 Protocol: per-session dfa block in intervals.json (artifact-filtered avg,
  4-zone TIZ split with HR/power cross-references, drift, LT1/LT2 crossing-band estimates,
  quality gates). New generic streams fetcher infrastructure (_fetch_activity_streams). dfa_a1_profile
  in latest.json capability block (latest_session + trailing_by_sport with confidence + validation
  flags). Always emits dfa block when streams fetched, even if quality.sufficient is False, so the
  AI can distinguish "no AlphaHRV" from "AlphaHRV ran but unusable". Intervals retention 8d → 14d
  to support drift analysis across multiple AlphaHRV sessions. Sport scope: all interval families;
  threshold mapping (1.0/0.5) cycling-validated, other sports flagged validated=False.
  Requires AlphaHRV Connect IQ data field, direct Garmin sync (Strava strips dev fields).

Version 3.98 - Schema rename: derived_metrics.polarisation_index → easy_time_ratio (and _note).
  Disambiguates from Seiler polarization_index (Treff PI). Rename only — no formula or value change.

Version 3.97 - Readiness signal hygiene: low-side ACWR removed from readiness_decision ambers
  and ACWR alerts — low ACWR is a load-state/undertraining context signal, not a fatigue signal,
  and already surfaces via acwr_interpretation. RI amber now requires 2-day persistence (ri<0.7
  today AND yesterday) to filter single-night noise; red still fires on any single day <0.6.
  New derived metric: recovery_index_yesterday. ACWR high-side boundary unified across code and
  docs: >=1.3 amber/caution, >=1.5 red/danger (replaces mixed >/>= usage).

Version 3.96 - Course character fix: elevation_per_km as sole density metric (total elevation
  is distance-blind); absolute elevation thresholds removed. Climb-category upgrade retained for
  "flat with one big climb" cases.

Version 3.95–3.88 — Polyline + event metadata; phase detection live weekly rows; Route & Terrain Intelligence (GPX/TCX → routes.json); local-sync auto-clear on script change; Sustainability Profile (per-sport power/HR for race estimation); sleep signal simplified to hours-only; phase detection current-week runtime overlay; HR Curve Delta (4 anchor durations, cross-sport).

Version 3.87–3.85 — Power curve delta, primary sport TSS filtering for phase detection, wellness field expansion
Version 3.84–3.80 — Activity description passthrough, per-sport zone preference, interval-level data, feel removed from readiness, orphan cleanup
Versions 3.7–3.79 — Phase detection v2, readiness decision, HRRc, week alignment, local sync pipeline, hash manifest, feel/RPE fix
Versions 3.3.0–3.6.5 — EF tracking, HR zone fallback, race calendar, durability, TID, alerts, history.json, smart fitness metrics

These measure HOW the athlete expresses fitness, not just load. Use these for coaching context alongside traditional load metrics. Durability and EF trend direction matters more than absolute values. HRRc is display only — higher = better parasympathetic recovery. Power curve delta rotation_index reveals whether gains are sprint-biased (positive) or endurance-biased (negative). HR curve delta is ambiguous — rising max sustained HR may indicate fitness or fatigue; cross-reference with resting HRV/HR and RPE. Sustainability profile provides race estimation lookup: actual MMP, Coggan predicted (cycling only), CP/W' model (cycling only), model_divergence_pct (actual vs CP — divergence IS the coaching signal). CP/W' is primary for durations ≤20min; Coggan duration factors are the established reference for ≥60min.

Crossing-band estimates: HR is pooled across all sessions; watts are split by environment for cycling (watts_outdoor, watts_indoor with per-environment n_sessions) — compare watts_outdoor against ftp, watts_indoor against ftp_indoor. Non-cycling sports keep pooled watts. Estimates are provisional at confidence='low' (suppressed for calibration delta surfacing) and usable at 'moderate' or 'high'. DFA a1 is a Tier-2 interpretive signal — does NOT enter readiness P0–P3 ladder, does NOT auto-update dossier zones; surfaces calibration deltas only.

        Build per-sport sustainability profile for race estimation (v3.91).

        sport-specific anchor durations from a single wider window (42d default).
        
        Three model layers for cycling:
        1. Actual MMP — observed from training data
        2. Coggan predicted — FTP × duration factor (Allen & Coggan, 3rd ed.)
        3. CP/W' predicted — P = CP + W'/t (Skiba critical power model)
        
        Non-cycling power sports get actual MMP only (no published duration
        factors, no sport-specific CP/W' values).
        
        Indoor/outdoor handling (cycling only): fetches Ride and VirtualRide
        separately, takes max at each anchor. Source flag indicates which
        environment produced the best effort.
